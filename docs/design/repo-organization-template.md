# Repo Organization Template

A standard skeleton for projects that ship a Python library alongside one or more deployed platform services (REST API, MCP server, CLI, etc.).

## Principles

**`lib/` is the single source of truth for business logic.** All domain code lives here. Platform services import from `lib` and add only the translation layer required by their interface (HTTP routing, MCP tool definitions, CLI argument parsing).

**Each platform service is independently deployable.** Services have their own `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, and `scripts/`. They can be built, versioned, and deployed on separate schedules.

**`scripts/` is consistent across all components.** Every component (lib and each platform service) has a `scripts/` directory with the same two roles: build and publish/deploy. This keeps automation uniform regardless of the component type.

**Tests are co-located with the code they test.** Library tests live under `lib/tests/`. Platform adapter tests live under `platform/<service>/tests/`. Platform tests import shared fixtures and test doubles from `lib/tests/` rather than duplicating them.

**`types.py` owns the data contracts.** Shared types used across layers and by platform adapters are defined in `lib/src/<lib_package>/types.py`. This prevents circular imports and provides a single location to update when contracts change.

## `scripts/` Reference

| Component | `build.sh` | `deploy.sh` / `publish.sh` |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| `lib/` | `python -m build` (wheel + sdist) | `twine upload` to PyPI |
| Containerized service | `docker build` | Push image + deploy to target |
| CLI / distributable | Build package or standalone binary | Publish to PyPI or release channel |

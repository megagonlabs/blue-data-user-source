# Design Process

For new projects, work through the following design documents in order, creating each one before moving to implementation.

## Document Sequence

1. **Overview** — objective, what the system does, design philosophy
2. **Scenarios** — use cases describing how the system is used in practice
3. **High Level Architecture** — key components and their interfaces
4. **Detailed Architecture** — flow of information between key components
5. **Software Stack** — languages, frameworks, and key dependencies
6. **Library** — key classes and functions
7. **Repo Organization** — file structure of the repository
8. **Coding Style** — language, formatting, and conventions
9. **API / Interface Spec** — external-facing APIs (REST, CLI, etc.)
10. **Data Model** — schema definitions, entity relationships, data flow
11. **Testing Strategy** — what to test, at what level, and how
12. **Deployment / Ops** — environment setup, configuration, infrastructure
13. **Decision Log (ADR)** — architectural decisions and their rationale

## Guidelines

- Create documents one at a time, in order
- Each document informs the next — do not skip ahead
- Store all design documents in the `docs/design/` directory at the repo root
- Name files with a numeric prefix matching the sequence above (e.g. `01-overview.md`)
- Create the decision log file at the start of design (step 1) and add entries throughout; do not wait until the end
- When iterative coding begins, suggest libraries and other software for the component under development and confirm choices before writing any code

## Review Protocol (per document)

After receiving user input for each document:

1. **Completeness review** — assess the input and suggest anything missing or underspecified before finalizing the document
2. **Integrity check** — after the document is written, verify consistency with all previously completed documents; flag any discrepancies, contradictions, or gaps to the user before proceeding to the next step

# UDb — Library

> External dependencies: `blue-data-core` provides `DataSource`, `FileSource`, `SessionSource`, `Session`, `DataPlanner`, `DataRegistry`, and related base classes.

---

## UserSource(DataSource)

Entry point for all UDb operations. Holds a `UserQueryReasoner` for reasoning and a `UserDataManager` for data operations.

### Constructor

```python
UserSource(properties={})
```

### Example

```python
us = UserSource(properties={})

eser_db = "5WgRzdacRdOEvj8JBmCXFZSvWmH3"
us.create_database(eser_db)

# Type 1 import — register source for later querying
fs = FileSource("~/resume.txt")
us.import(fs, database=eser_db)

# Type 2 import — extract structured data from source
us.import(fs, database=eser_db, optional_properties={"queries": ["what skills does user have?"]})

# Import active session as a streaming source
session = Session()
ss = session.get_source()
us.import(ss, database=eser_db)

# Query
results = us.execute_query(
    "jobs suitable for me",
    database=eser_db,
    optional_properties={"session": session.cid}
)
```

### Methods

#### `execute_query(query, database=None, optional_properties={})`

Executes a natural language query against a user database.

**Parameters**

- `query` — natural language query; may be partial or complete
- `database` — user database identifier
- `optional_properties`:
  - `"session"` — session ID; used as query context and as the primary contact method for user 
  interaction
  - `"output"` - output format; defaults to JSON, other options include "NL", "CSV", etc.
  - `"prompt"` - prompt to translate structured data to natural language

**Returns**

List of result objects, one per question in the resolved question set:

```python
[{"query": "<question>", "results": [...]}, ...]
```

Includes the original query if it has full coverage, plus any complementary queries that were necessary.

**Algorithm**

1. Instantiate `UserQueryReasoner(source=self, database=database)`
2. Call `reasoner.contextualize_query(query)` to rewrite query for user data context
3. Call `reasoner.expand_query(query)` to produce complementary question set Q
4. For each qi in Q:
   - (a) Call `data_manager.execute_query(qi, database)` → `(qi, di, md_i)`
   - (b) Call `reasoner.assess_query_results(qi, di, md_i)` → metric scores `Mi`
   - (c) Call `reasoner.assess_user_verification(qi, di, md_i, Mi)` → interaction needed?
   - (d) If interaction required: instantiate `ContactManager` and pass `(qi, di, Mi)` to Interaction Layer; repeat until metrics satisfactory
5. Return all resolved `(qi, di, Mi)` as results

#### `import(source, database=None, optional_properties={})`

Imports data from an external source into the user database.

**Parameters**

- `source` — a `DataSource` instance (e.g. `FileSource`, `SessionSource` from `blue-data-core`)
- `database` — user database identifier
- `optional_properties`:
  - `"queries"` — list of natural language queries to execute over the source; only results are imported

**Behavior**

- No queries specified (Type 1): delegates to `UserDataManager.import_source(source, database)` — source is registered in the user's source registry as user-specific metadata
- Queries specified (Type 2): delegates to `UserDataManager.import_source(source, database, queries)` — each query is executed over the source and results are injected into generic user data stores

#### `create_user(name)`

Delegates to `UserDataManager.create_user(name)`.

#### `create_database(name)`

Alias for `create_user(name)`.

---

## UserQueryReasoner

Encapsulates query rewriting, metric-based result assessment, and user interaction coordination for a specific user database. Instantiated per `execute_query` call. Instantiates `ContactManager` when user interaction is required.

### Constructor

```python
UserQueryReasoner(source, database)
```

Instantiates with a set of `UserDataMetric` instances.

**Parameters**

- `source` — the parent `UserSource` instance
- `database` — user database identifier

### Methods

#### `contextualize_query(query)`

Rewrites the query to be more suitable for user data retrieval.

**Example:** `"jobs suitable for me"` → `"What jobs are suitable for this user?"`

#### `expand_query(query)`

Returns a list of complementary questions providing context for the original query. May draw on existing user data.

**Example**

Input: `"jobs suitable for me"`

Output:
```python
[
    "What skills does the user have?",
    "What titles is the user interested in?",
    "Does the user have location constraints?",
    "What is the user's expected compensation?",
    "Does the user prefer remote work?"
]
```

#### `assess_query_results(query, query_results, query_results_metadata)`

Returns an aggregate metric evaluation report — score and reasoning per applicable metric. Internally calls `_identify_user_data_metrics` to determine which metrics apply.

#### `assess_user_verification(query, query_results, query_results_metadata, user_data_metric_evaluation)`

Returns a user verification report indicating whether user interaction is required, including score and reasoning.

#### `_identify_user_data_metrics(query, query_results, query_results_metadata)`

Returns the filtered list of `UserDataMetric` instances relevant to the given query and results.

---

## UserDataMetric

An agent that evaluates one quality dimension of query results (e.g. freshness, completeness).

### Constructor

```python
UserDataMetric(properties)
```

### Example

```python
freshness = UserDataMetric(properties)
report = freshness.evaluate(query, query_results, query_results_metadata)
```

### Methods

#### `evaluate(query, query_results, query_results_metadata)`

Returns a metric evaluation report including score and reasoning.

---

## UserDataManager

Manages all data sources for a user database — generic stores and user-specific sources — through a `UserDataRegistry`.

### Constructor

Instantiates a `UserDataRegistry` backed by `JSONSource` and `VectorSource` as generic stores, and prepares the `UserDataPlanner`.

### Data Model per User

**Metadata** (stored in `JSONSource`):

- General profile (name, picture, last_login, etc.)
- Contact methods (phone number, email address, messaging handles, etc.)
- List of registered user-specific sources (FileSource, SessionSource, etc.)

**Data**:

- Semi-structured data in `JSONSource`
- Vectorized data in `VectorSource`
- Data from registered user-specific sources (FileSource, SessionSource, etc.)

### Methods

#### `execute_query(query, database)`

Executes a query against user data.

**Algorithm**

1. Call `UserDataPlanner.plan(query, database)` to decompose the query into subqueries and identify relevant sources for each
2. For each `(subquery, source)` pair in the plan: call `UserDataRegistry.execute(subquery, source)` to retrieve results
3. Aggregate and normalize results into `(q, d, md)` tuples, where `md` includes provenance (source, timestamp, confidence)
4. Return result set

#### `create_user(name)`

Creates a new virtual user database: initializes `JSONSource` and `VectorSource` entries in the registry for the user.

`name` is a unique user identifier.

#### `import_source(source, database, queries=None)`

- `queries=None`: registers `source` in `UserDataRegistry` as a user-specific source (Type 1)
- `queries` provided: executes each query over `source` and inserts results into generic stores — `JSONSource` or `VectorSource` as appropriate (Type 2)

---

## UserDataPlanner(DataPlanner)

Produces an execution plan for a query by decomposing it into subqueries and mapping each to relevant sources in the registry.

### Methods

#### `plan(query, database)`

Returns an execution plan: a list of `(subquery, source)` pairs derived from sources registered in `UserDataRegistry` for the given user.

---

## UserDataRegistry(DataRegistry)

A user-scoped data registry. Maintains all data sources for a given user — generic stores (`JSONSource`, `VectorSource`) and registered user-specific sources — and supports both structured and natural language query execution.

---

## ContactManager

Manages contact methods for a user and selects the most appropriate channel for a given interaction context. Contact method data is stored in user metadata (`JSONSource`).

Instantiated by `UserQueryReasoner` when `assess_user_verification` determines user interaction is required.

### Constructor

```python
ContactManager(database, data_manager)
```

Loads contact methods from user metadata via `UserDataManager`.

### Methods

#### `identify_contact_method(query)`

Returns the `ContactMethod` most suitable for the given interaction context (e.g. active session if user is present, email otherwise).

#### `get_contact_methods(name=None, protocol=None)`

Returns all contact methods, optionally filtered by name or protocol.

---

## ContactMethod

Stores metadata for one contact channel and provides access to an `InteractionManager` for that channel.

### Constructor

```python
ContactMethod(details, protocol)
```

Supported protocols: `session`, `email`, `sms`, `stdio`, messaging applications, enterprise messaging systems, notifications.

### Methods

#### `interact()`

Returns an `InteractionManager` configured for this contact method.

---

## InteractionManager

Manages a single interaction with the user through a specific contact channel. Corresponds to the Interaction Manager component in the architecture.

### Constructor

```python
InteractionManager(on_start, on_response, on_stop)
```

### Methods

#### `start()`

Starts the interaction. Calls `_on_start()`.

#### `stop()`

Ends the interaction. Calls `_on_stop()`.

#### `send(message, async=False)`

Sends a message to the user.

- `async=False` — blocks and returns the user response directly
- `async=True` — returns a `Future` to be awaited

Calls `_on_response()` on receipt.

#### `_on_start()`

#### `_on_response(message)`

#### `_on_stop()`
